2.  **Select Objects:** Select one or more mesh, curve, or metaball objects you want to export in the 3D Viewport.
3.  **Configure Settings:** Adjust the settings in the "EasyMesh Batch Exporter" panel:
    
    ### Basic Settings
    * **Export Path:** Choose the directory where files will be saved
    * **Format:** Select output format (FBX, OBJ, glTF, USD, STL)
    * **Coordinate System:** Set Forward and Up axes for your target application
    * **Scale & Units:** Set global scale and choose between metres/centimetres
    * **Smoothing:** Select smoothing method (Face, Edge, Off) for supported formats
    
    ### Transform & Processing
    * **Zero Location:** Set object location to (0,0,0) before export
    * **Modifier Mode:** Choose which modifiers to apply:
      * **None:** Skip all modifiers (fastest, export base mesh only)

## Performance & Large Mesh Handling

### 🔧 **Automatic Optimisations**
The add-on automatically detects and optimises for large meshes:

* **500K+ polygons:** Basic memory management with progressive cleanup
* **1M+ polygons:** Aggressive memory optimisation and pre-processing cleanup
* **Memory cleanup:** Automatic garbage collection every 3 modifiers during heavy operations
* **Smart processing:** Different strategies based on mesh complexity
* **LOD Reuse:** Progressive building reduces memory by 60% and time by 40-50%

### 💡 **Performance Tips**

#### For Large Meshes (500K+ polygons):
* **Use "None" modifiers:** Skip modifier application for fastest export
* **Close other applications:** Maximise available system memory
* **Export in batches:** Process fewer objects at once to reduce memory pressure
* **Monitor console:** Watch for "Memory optimisation" messages

#### For Very Large Meshes (1M+ polygons):
* **Strongly recommend "None" modifiers:** Avoid modifier processing when possible
* **Single object exports:** Export one object at a time for maximum stability
* **LOD generation:** Use LODs to create multiple resolution versions efficiently

#### Modifier Application Guidelines:
* **"None":** Best performance, exports base mesh without any modifications
* **"Visible":** Good balance of functionality and performance (default)
* **"Render":** Most complete but may impact performance on large meshes

### 📊 **Console Output**
Monitor the console for detailed information:
```
INFO: Applying memory optimisation for large mesh: 1,250,000 polygons
INFO: Large mesh export: 1,250,000 polygons
INFO: Memory cleanup after 3 modifiers
INFO: Decimation complete: 1,250,000 → 312,500 polys (target: 0.250, actual: 0.250)
```

## Export Indicators

* After an object is successfully exported (including all its LODs if enabled), it will be marked in the viewport.
* **Green:** Object exported within the last minute (`FRESH`).
* **Yellow:** Object exported within the last 5 minutes (`STALE`).
* **Normal Colour:** Object export indicator has expired, or indicators were cleared.
* **Toggle Location:** The export indicators checkbox is now conveniently located in the header of the "Recent Exports" panel.
* **Visibility:** To see these colours in the 3D Viewport, ensure you are in **Solid** display mode and that the **Shading -> Colour** type is set to **Object**.
    [[Viewport Shading Docs]](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/3dview/display/shading.html#solid)
* **Recent Exports Panel:** When indicators are enabled, shows a list of recently exported objects (still FRESH or STALE). Clicking the icon selects the object.
* **Clear Indicators:** The "Clear All Export Indicators" button at the bottom of the "Recent Exports" panel will immediately remove the status from all objects and restore their original viewport colours.
* **Auto-Clear:** Unchecking the indicators checkbox immediately clears all existing indicators from the viewport.
